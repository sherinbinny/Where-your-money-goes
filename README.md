### Front end Development Task for Tearfund

### Running Instructions

   ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

### Future Development

1. **Accessibility**: Webpage isn't accessible for people with disabilities.

2. **Image Loading**: Background image might take a bit longer to show up on the webpage because it's quite big.

3. **Code Comments**: Didn't get a chance to add comments to describe how code works.
